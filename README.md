# ReactDoubts
Issue:-
  Does React lifecycle work differently when using useEffect ?
  
To Notice difference:- 
  - First copy the aboutUs and ProfileClass in your project (I used the swiggy project) and run it
  - Write down what you see in console (or just take that page offline)
  - Second copy the profile file and use it instead of profileClass and run it
  - You'll see the difference in console ...

Note:- in aboutUs file i have "<"Outlet/">" in which I passed the Profile class
